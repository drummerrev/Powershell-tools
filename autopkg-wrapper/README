This Autopkg Py script was created to streamline and automate some technician tasks
associated with the use of Autopkg for pulling specific repositories (based upon a 
file listing the requested pkgs), and would then create desktop folders for each
newly acquired package, would query VirusTotal for information on the downloaded pkgs, 
and would open a web browser to upload the pkgs into the JSS.
